# DCVtestkit 0.0.1.9000 (development version)

## TODO

* Check if dilution factor definition is clear enough.

## Completed

* Update the Sample Type to be the same as the LIMS in SLING.
* Changed the excel sheet font to "Consolas" so that the number "0" and the letter "O" can be differentiated easily.
* Match the buttons with the relevant column colours in the sheet.
* Added a new button to auto fill the sample amount, sample amount unit and the istd mixture volumne column based on the QC sample type.
* If user change the concentration Custom_Unit in the ISTD_Annot sheet and there are values in the Custom Unit in the ISTD_Annot sheet and values in the Sample Amount in the Sample_Annot sheet, the software will auto fill the concentration unit. This is to ensure the right concentration unit is updated correctly.

# MSTemplate_Creator 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Aim to create a git tag version.
